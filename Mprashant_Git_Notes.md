# What is Git Commit?
    -> A git commit is a command in git that captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes, creating a permanent record in the repository's history.

# Why this happens?
-> Git uses a pager for long outputs so you can scroll.
-> Common pager keys:
* q → quit
* ↑ / ↓ → scroll
* Space → next page
* b → previous page
